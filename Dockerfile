#   - a single writable volume: /data
#   - runs as a non-root user
#   - multi-arch image (linux/amd64 + linux/arm64), see the CI workflow

# The only writable location allowed at runtime. Docker creates a new volume
# with the owner of the image's /data, so it must belong to `node`, and before
# VOLUME: changes made to /data after it are discarded. Without this, /data is
# root-owned and the integration cannot write to it — the synchronization
# cursor then lives in memory only and the history is re-imported on restart.
